The database is a dictionary, in which a pet's name acts as the key and the value holds the type of animal (e.g. 'kitty': 'cat'). We'll assume that no two animals have the same name. Use a `while` loop to allow a user to add entries by first asking for the name of the pet and then for its type. Then ask the user if they want to add another entry.\n",
